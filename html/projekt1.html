      Kobe Bryant spent his early years in Italy and joined the NBA straight out
      of high school. A dominant scorer, Bryant won five NBA championships and
      the 2008 MVP Award with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although later seasons
      were marred by injuries, he surpassed Michael Jordan for third place on
      the NBA all-time scoring list in December 2014 and retired in 2016 after
      scoring 60 points in his final game. In 2018, Bryant earned an Academy
      Award for Best Animated Short Film for Dear Basketball. On January 26,
      2020, he was in a helicopter crash that killed Bryant, his 13-year-old
      daughter Gigi and seven others.
